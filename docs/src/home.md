# Welcome to the `haddock-runner` docs

The `haddock-runner` are an effort to reduce code duplication and to streamline the execution of HADDOCK benchmark. It is a standalone program written in [`go`](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)>)that can be used to run HADDOCK on a set of benchmark targets. It is designed to be used with both the production-ready [HADDOCK2.4](/software/haddock2.4), the pre-release _HADDOCK2.5_ and the experimental (unpublished) [HADDOCK3](/software/haddock3) versions.

When running a benchmark, users/developers may be interested in the following (in no specific order):

- The quality of the docking results when using different parameters
- Comparing the results of different versions
- The time it takes to run HADDOCK on a set of targets

However the `haddock-runner` can be used to run HADDOCK on a large set of targets such as for virtual screening.

Have a look at the menu on the left for more information.
