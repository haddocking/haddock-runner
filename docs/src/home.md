# Welcome to the `haddock-runner` docs

The `haddock-runner` is an effort to reduce code duplication and to streamline
the execution of HADDOCK benchmarks.

It is a standalone program, freely available at [https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-runner](https://github.com/haddocking/haddock-runner).

It is designed to be used with both [HADDOCK2.4/5](/software/haddock2.4), and
[HADDOCK3](/software/haddock3) versions.

When running a benchmark, users/developers may be interested in the following
(in no specific order):

- The quality of the docking results when using different parameters
- Comparing the results of different versions
- The time it takes to run HADDOCK on a set of targets

Have a look at the menu on the left for more information on how to use it.
